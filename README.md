# Architecture

The website is hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from this very same repository. The source of the website is in the *jekyll-pages* branch and the HTML is generated to the *master* branch.

# Contributing Content

First step is to install Jekyll. There is great [Installation Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on their website that should do the trick. Once Jekyll is installed there are couple of ways how to set up your workflow.

# Making Changes Locally

Open up the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) *md* files up in your favourite editor and make changes as you wish. To see them in action run ```jekyll serve``` in the *jekyll-pages* branch and Jekyll will spawn a webserve serving the content on [localhost on port 4000](http://localhost:4000/).

# Pushing Changes to Website

Once you are finished with everything you are ready to update the actual HTML. Commit everything you've done and generate a site based on your changes. Here the easiest is to checkout the same project to a separate folder. For example ```../perf-pipeline-master```. So now you will have 2 folders with the project source code. One of them will be on the branch *jekyll-pages* (the one you are making Markdown changes at) and the new one on branch *master*.

Now issue a command to generate the site to the folder that has the *master* branch active. This example will generate the HTML to the folder ```.../perf-pipeline-master```.

```bash
jekyll build --destination ../perf-pipeline-master
```

Now the updated website sits in the *master* branch version of the repository. You are ready to commit the changes in that branch and push them to Github. Once that happens you will see the website updated at [Performance Pipeline website](http://performance-pipeline.org/).
