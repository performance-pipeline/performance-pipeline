    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Improving the performance of your application is an investment. If you tolerate poor application performance, you’re accepting loss of revenue and upset or lost users to competitors and more. To make performance a priority, you need to giving it the necessary attention during every release. We already know testing is cheaper and easier to perform when it’s done early. Performance issues can be found early on that would be more complex and take consuming to fix if left.</p>

<p>In practice, Quality Assurance (QA) testing is more proficient at this mindset. QA practices uses different tools and processes to find different types of issues at each stage of the application lifecycle. This ensures that the end product is properly tested and more likely have fewer QA issues. The equivalent process for performance, is the Performance Pipeline, a strategy that focuses on performance at every stage of your application lifecycle.</p>

<h2 id="the-performance-pipeline">The Performance Pipeline</h2>

<p>When you think of traditional performance testing, many will think about long running, load and stress tests in a production-like environment that is only run towards the end of your application lifecycle. However, there are many other types of performance tests that can be run at every stage of the application lifecycle, rather just at the later stages. By testing in earlier phases, bugs are easier, cheaper and much more convenient to fix, using simple use cases.</p>

<p><img src="/images/performance-pipeline.png" alt="performance-pipeline-image" title="The Performance Pipeline" /></p>

<p>The performance pipeline focuses on performance at every stage of our application lifecycle. However, you need to be smart about what can be achieved at each stage. For example, chasing milliseconds during development isn’t effective, as our production environment will differ considerably. Let’s explore what you should think about and test at every stage of the application lifecycle.</p>

<h2 id="the-pipeline-phases">The Pipeline Phases</h2>

<p>The five phases of the performance pipeline are as follows: Requirements Analysis, Design, Development, Test, and Production. You should be focused on the performance of your application at every one of these phases. Click through for more details on each stage.</p>

<h2 id="requirements-analysisrequirements-analysis"><a href="/requirements-analysis/">Requirements Analysis</a></h2>

<p>Performance requirements must be added to your projects at the same time as your functional requirements. You should state clear demands that you expect from your finished project at this stage that all your decisions should be used in subsequent phases. There’s no such thing as a project or functional requirement not having a performance requirement. Make sure your performance requirements are measurable, and precise, by avoiding such language such as “all” and “every”. Try to be explicit with your requirements. <a href="/requirements-analysis/">More…</a></p>

<h2 id="designdesign"><a href="/design/">Design</a></h2>

<p>Don’t use architectures and designs that prevent you achieving your performance requirements. Prototyping can give you have confidence your design meets your expectations. Databases interaction are expensive. Make sure you only go there when you need to, and batch requests where possible. If you intend to use third party endpoints, make sure they can guarantee the requirements you have. <a href="/design/">More…</a></p>

<h2 id="developmentdevelopment"><a href="/development/">Development</a></h2>

<p>Databases and inefficient code are the most likely areas for performance issues.  Be aware of how many interactions with the database you code is making, how long they’re taking, whether you’re getting too much or not enough data etc. Understand where your code is spending most of its time in the request and whether that’s reasonable at this stage. Consider the performance implications of code changes during your code reviews and consider them as important as functional errors. <a href="/development/">More…</a></p>

<h2 id="testtest"><a href="/test/">Test</a></h2>

<p>The test phase goes from Continuous Integration activities through to staging. Use your existing automated test suites to measure regressions across builds during Continuous Integration environments. When testing load and stress tests, always take baselines that you can measure against and use for comparison. Use varieties of load, stress, spike and soak testing to find different issues. Consider replaying production traffic in your staging environment for a closer real life representation of production than just synthesized load. <a href="/test/">More…</a></p>

<h2 id="productionproduction"><a href="/production/">Production</a></h2>

<p>In this phase,  you need to live up to your Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and meet the expectations set in the requirements analysis phase. To ensure your requirements are met, utilize various solutions to analyze, measure and then provide reports, on a monthly basis. Production focused solutions like application performance management (APM) and flow analysis, provide in-depth data on the underlying causes that affect application QoS, but they only reveal that an issue exists. <a href="/production/">More…</a></p>
